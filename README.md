# Unsolved Problems
As of right now, the largest issue that still remains to be solved is the issue regarding persisting user cart information between sign-out and sign-in. Currently, when a user signs-out, their cart data is lost and does not persist so that the user can come back to it when they sign in. This issue is isolated to the handleAddToCart method and is primarily the result of the user cart state not getting properly modified.

# Future Enhancements
While this project certainly exhibits a multitude of functionality, there are certain elements that I am hoping to improve upon and include in the coming weeks. 
1. I will be adding a "WishList" feature that will allow users to send a particular item to a wish list that can be accessed at a later time for purchase.
2. I will be integrating 3 Joke APIs (icanhazdadjoke, icndb & programmableweb.com)
3. I will be completing/finishing the full integration of the PayPal pay feature which should direct the user through to a PayPal portal.
